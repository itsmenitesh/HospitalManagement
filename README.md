## Framework Used
* Spring Boot

---
<br>

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the project:

* Spring Boot Dev Tools
* Spring Web
* Spring Data JPA
* MySQL Driver
* Lombok

<br>

## Database Configuration
By adding the correct database URL, user name, and password to the application.properties file, you may connect to a MySQL database. It's time to update the following properties:
```
spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/<DatabaseName>
spring.datasource.username = <userName>
spring.datasource.password = <password>
spring.jpa.show-sql = true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = update

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=true
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

```
<br>

## Language Used
* Java

## Data Flow

1. Through the application's API endpoints, the user submits a request from the client side.
2. After receiving the request, the API routes it to the proper controller method.
3. The service class method is called by the controller function.
4. The controller class receives instructions from the method in the service class, which constructs logic and obtains or alters data from the database.
5. The controller method sends an API response.
6. The user receives the API's answer.

## Project Summary
Using Spring Boot, Java, and MySQL, the hospital Management API was created as a RESTful API. It offers a complete answer for controlling appointments, patient and physician data, and more inside a healthcare system. Through the API, patients may register, log in, schedule appointments with available providers, and, if necessary, cancel appointments. A doctor's appointment schedule may be retrieved and entered to the system.
